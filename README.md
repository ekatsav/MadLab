# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

**This is now bold text, very cool**
*This is italic, also super duper cool*

~~this text will be struck through, cancelled forever~~

>This text becomes a quote!

To make text appear as code we use `back ticks`

```Creates a whole block of code... Useful for sending copy paste code mayhaps? Do you keep your indentations??```
